# postgraduate-D74
Today is Sunday. I have to go to work tomorrow. I really don't want to go to work. I thought programming was very interesting before, but now I feel a little bored. I don't know why. I can't learn it at home. I feel that I can learn it only in the library or in the company. I hope I can maintain such enthusiasm to learn in the UK, I feel that the sentence has been fulfilled. Low difficulty and medium difficulty will make people more passionate to learn. If something to learn is too difficult, it depends on their own perseverance. It's ironic. I have nothing to say.
